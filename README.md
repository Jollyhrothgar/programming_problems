# Computer Science Practice Problems

This repository contains a collection of programming practice problems and their solutions, designed for studying computer science concepts, particularly for interview preparation. Each directory within this repository is dedicated to a specific problem, containing the solution code, test cases, and often an optimized version of the solution.

## Problem Directory

Below is a conceptually organized list of the problems available in this repository, categorized by the primary computer science topic or problem-solving methodology they demonstrate.

### Dynamic Programming

*   **FizzBuzz Sum**
    *   **Description**: This problem involves calculating the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a given target number.
    *   **Concepts**: The solution demonstrates the use of dynamic programming, specifically memoization and a bottom-up (tabulation) approach for optimization. This is a good example of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems and storing their results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Data Structures

*   **Linked List Cycle Detection**
    *   **Description**: This problem, based on LeetCode problem 141, requires determining if a given linked list contains a cycle.
    *   **Concepts**: The solution explores the properties of linked lists. The provided solution uses a hash set to keep track of visited nodes, which is a common approach for cycle detection. The problem statement also challenges the solver to find a solution with O(1) memory complexity, hinting at algorithms like Floyd's Tortoise and Hare.
