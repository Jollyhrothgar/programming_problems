# Coding Practice Problems

This repository contains a collection of solutions to various coding problems, implemented in Python. Each problem is in its own directory and includes the problem description, solutions, and analysis.

## Conceptual Guide

This guide categorizes the problems by the primary computer science concepts they demonstrate.

### Arrays and Matrices

-   **[Merge Sorted Array (LeetCode 88)](./cs_problems/merge_sorted_array_leetcode_88/)**: Demonstrates an efficient, in-place, three-pointer technique for merging two sorted arrays.
-   **[Remove Element (LeetCode 27)](./cs_problems/leetcode_27_remove_element/)**: Showcases the two-pointer pattern for in-place array manipulation.
-   **[Same Stripes](./cs_problems/data_lemur_same_stripes/)**: Involves matrix traversal to check for a specific pattern (diagonal stripes).

### Linked Lists

-   **[Linked List Cycle (LeetCode 141)](./cs_problems/linked_list_cycle_leetcode_141/)**: A classic problem that introduces Floyd's "Tortoise and the Hare" cycle-finding algorithm, a key technique for cycle detection in `O(1)` space.

### Dynamic Programming

-   **[Fizz Buzz Sum](./cs_problems/fizz_buzz_sum/)**: Explores memoization and tabulation (a bottom-up DP approach) to optimize a summation problem by caching intermediate results.

### Mathematical and Bit Manipulation

-   **[Base 13 Conversion](./cs_problems/data_lemur_base_13_conversion/)**: Illustrates the standard algorithm for base conversion using repeated division and modulo operations.
