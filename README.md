# CS Practice Problems: A Conceptual Guide

This repository contains a collection of solutions to common computer science problems, organized by concept. Each problem includes a standard solution, an optimal solution, and a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between them.

## Concepts and Problems

### Dynamic Programming

-   **[Fizz Buzz Sum](./cs_problems/fizz_buzz_sum/README.md)**
    -   *Description:* A variation of the classic FizzBuzz problem that involves summing multiples of 3 or 5. This problem is used to introduce the concept of memoization and bottom-up dynamic programming.
    -   *Concepts Illustrated:* Memoization, Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP).

### Linked Lists

-   **[Linked List Cycle (LeetCode 141)](./cs_problems/linked_list_cycle_leetcode_141/README.md)**
    -   *Description:* Determine if a linked list contains a cycle.
    -   *Concepts Illustrated:* Hash Set for tracking visited nodes, Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).

### Arrays and Two Pointers

-   **[Merge Sorted Array (LeetCode 88)](./cs_problems/merge_sorted_array_leetcode_88/README.md)**
    -   *Description:* Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array, in-place.
    -   *Concepts Illustrated:* In-place algorithms, three-pointer technique.
