1. Assume that this repository contains programming practice problems which can
be used to study computer science concepts for interviews.

2. Each directory contains a problem that was solved, test cases, and sometimes
an optimal solution.

3. I want a top level README.md file that creates a conceptual map of the
problems that were solved. To do this, you need to read the python files in
each directory and the README files in each directory and the test files in
each directory. From these, create a nicely organized list (by topic) which
references the CS topic / problem solving methodolody used. This will be read
by a human to figure out where to find examples of particular CS problems.

4. After you collect context, create the top level README file. Do not modify
any other files.
